# Manifest Image Tester

Test what images devices use for your PWA! This manifest contains a bunch of images so you can see what devices are using everywhere. This is useful particularly when these things are not well documented!

## Included Icons

- Standard PWA sizes (192 and 512)
- Other power-of-2 (256, 384, etc., used in Android splash screens)
- Maskable versions of most sizes
- Apple-specific sizes

## How to Contribute

Please open a PR and let me know how to improve this! The goal is to create a good testbed for developers and designers to use to test PWAs.
